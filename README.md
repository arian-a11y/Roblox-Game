## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. **Roblox Studio** - Download from [roblox.com/create](https://www.roblox.com/create)
2. **VS Code** with extensions:
   - Rojo (evaera.vscode-rojo)
   - Luau Language Server (johnnymorganz.luau-lsp)
   - Roblox LSP (nightrains.robloxlsp)
3. **Rojo** - Install from [rojo.space](https://rojo.space/)

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone/Open the project** in VS Code
2. **Install Rojo** if not already installed
3. **Start Rojo server**:
   ```bash
   rojo serve
   ```
4. **Open Roblox Studio** and connect to the Rojo server
5. **Start developing** - changes in VS Code will sync to Studio

### Development Workflow

1. Write code in VS Code using the Luau language
2. Test in Roblox Studio with live sync via Rojo
3. Use the built-in testing tools for combat mechanics
4. Publish to Roblox when ready
